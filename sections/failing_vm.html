<%= circled_title(2, "Failing VM") %>

<p>What if there is a problem with instance that is running our service? BOSH offers manual and automatic recovery when there are problems with infrastructure resources like VMs or disks. In this exercise we are going to kill one of our instances and use manual recovery option.</p>

<p>Lets destroy one of our instances. SSH to BOSH Bastion VM.</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ gcloud compute ssh bosh-bastion</h4>
</div>

<p>Delete one of the instances.</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ gcloud compute instances delete id-1</h4>
</div>

<p>Let's see that one of the instances is in a bad state:</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ bosh instances</h4>
  <h4 class="terminal-printout-text">...
Instance    Process State       IPs
app/guid-1  running             10.0.0.10
app/guid-2  unresponsive agent  10.0.0.11
...</h4>
</div>

<p>One of the components in BOSH is the Health Monitor. It independently watches system health and will bring missing instances back up by instructing infrastructure to recreate missing resources like VMs with the required persistent disk. Keep running <b>bosh instances</b> and see that instance is brought up and service is running eventually.</p>

<p>Now let's turn off automatic repair and manually resolve the issue.</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ bosh update-resurrection off</h4>
</div>

<p>Kill one of the containers again as described above. Run cloud check and select option "Recreate VM and wait for processes to start".</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ bosh -d learn-bosh-on-gcp cloud-check</h4>
</div>

<p>Cloud check command allows to manually resolve issues when resources (VMs and persistent disks) are in a bad state. Run <b>bosh instances</b> to see all instances running again.</p>

<h1>Prepare</h1>

<p>We are going to use the BOSH Environment created using the scripts in the <a href="https://github.com/rigoford/bosh-on-gcp">bosh-on-gcp</a> repository. First we will create a BOSH Bastion in a dedicated GCP Project. The BOSH Bastion will have the BOSH CLI v2 installed, it is from this BOSH Bastion that we will create a BOSH Director. Once the BOSH Director is running we will use the BOSH CLI on the BOSH Bastion to send commands to the BOSH Director.</p>
